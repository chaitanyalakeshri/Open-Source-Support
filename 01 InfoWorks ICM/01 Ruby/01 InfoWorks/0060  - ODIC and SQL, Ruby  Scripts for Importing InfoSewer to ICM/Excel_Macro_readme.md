# Summary:
This macro converts Excel files with the ".dbf" extension located in a specified folder to CSV format and saves them in another specified folder. The macro disables screen updating, events, automatic calculations, and alerts during execution to improve performance and avoid interruptions. It prompts the user to select the source and destination folders using file dialog boxes. Then, it loops through all the ".dbf" files in the source folder, opens them one by one, saves them as CSV files in the destination folder, and closes them without saving changes.
