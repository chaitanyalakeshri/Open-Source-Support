# Step 2 - Import Links using ODIC

What is imported?
Link Asset ID, From and To Nodes, and a user_text_10 value of Pump. This will change later when we import the link hydraulic information. The file imported is the LINK.CSV file and the CFG file Step2_InfoSewer_Link_csv.cfg into the conduit data table (see below).
