# Code Summary: Enhancing InfoSewer Data Analysis and Import in ICM SWMM

## Script Overview
- The script begins by accessing the current open network in the InfoWorks application.

## Key Functions
1. **Method: `print_csv_inflows_file(open_net)`**
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes and prints statistics for various fields related to SWMM network nodes.
   - **Process**:
     - Defines a series of database fields for SWMM network nodes, such as 'us_invert', 'ds_invert', 'length', etc.
     - Collects and analyzes data for each field from `Sw_conduit` objects in the network.
     - Calculates and prints statistical measures (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, total) for each field.
     - Ensures clarity through formatted output, including the row count for each field.

2. **Data Import Process**
   - **Configuration and Paths**: Sets up the configuration and CSV file paths for importing data.
   - **Import Steps**: Outlines a series of steps for importing various data layers from CSV files using the ODIC import method.
   - **Error Handling**: Includes error handling to manage any issues during the import process.

3. **Execution Flow**
   - Retrieves information about the current scenario, version, unit settings, database, and network.
   - Executes the `print_csv_inflows_file` method to analyze and display initial data.
   - Iterates over a predefined set of import steps, importing data layers and handling any errors encountered.
   - Prints paths for configuration and CSV files.
   - Completes the import process and reaffirms by calling `print_csv_inflows_file` again to display updated data statistics.

## Summary
This script is a comprehensive tool for managing and analyzing SWMM network node data within InfoSewer and ICM SWMM environments. It effectively combines data analysis with import functionality, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of data management in water system modeling. The script is thoughtfully structured to provide clear insights into the data before and after import, ensuring a thorough understanding of the impact of data changes.
