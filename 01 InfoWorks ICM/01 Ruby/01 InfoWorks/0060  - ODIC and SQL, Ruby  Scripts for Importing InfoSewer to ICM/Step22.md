# Code Summary: Streamlining Manhole Loadings and Data Analysis in InfoSewer and ICM InfoWorks

## Libraries
- The script employs the `csv` library to facilitate operations with CSV files.

## Key Functions
1. **Method: `print_csv_inflows_file(open_net)`**
   - **Purpose**: To analyze and display statistical information for various fields related to SWMM network nodes.
   - **Process**:
     - Defines database fields such as 'ground_level', 'flood_level', 'chamber_area', etc.
     - Gathers data for these fields from the network nodes.
     - Calculates and prints out statistical data such as minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and total for each field.
     - Ensures readability and clarity through formatted output.

2. **Method: `import_node_loads(open_net)`**
   - **Purpose**: To import manhole loading data from a CSV file into the open network.
   - **Process**:
     - Prompts the user to select a scenario matching the InfoSewer dataset.
     - Reads data from the specified CSV file, constructing a hash for each row with fields like 'ID', 'DIAMETER', 'RIM_ELEV', etc.
     - Updates the corresponding fields in the network's 'hw_node' objects for each row in the CSV.

3. **Execution Flow**
   - Initiates by accessing the current open network.
   - Loops through each scenario in the network:
     - Sets the current scenario.
     - Begins a transaction.
     - Executes `import_node_loads` for data importation.
     - Commits the transaction.
     - Calls `print_csv_inflows_file` for data analysis and display.
   - Concludes with a message signaling the end of the import process.

## Summary
This script serves as an effective utility for importing and analyzing manhole loading data in InfoSewer scenarios, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of data management in water systems. It is designed with user interaction in mind, featuring scenario selection prompts and detailed data analysis, thus greatly enhancing the data handling capabilities in InfoSewer and ICM InfoWorks.
