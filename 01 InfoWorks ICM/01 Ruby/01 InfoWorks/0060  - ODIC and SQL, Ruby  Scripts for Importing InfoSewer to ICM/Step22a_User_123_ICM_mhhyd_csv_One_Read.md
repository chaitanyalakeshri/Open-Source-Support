## Summary of Ruby Script for Importing InfoSewer Data into ICM InfoWorks

### Overview
This Ruby script imports manhole hydraulic and load data from an InfoSewer dataset into an ICM InfoWorks scenario. It performs various data manipulations and calculations on the imported data.

### Key Functions

#### `print_csv_inflows_file`
- Collects and prints statistical data (min, max, mean, standard deviation, total, and row count) for specified database fields from `hw_node` objects in the open network.
- Fields include ground level, flood level, chamber area, shaft area, and user numbers 1 through 10.
- Uses `printf` to format and display the statistical data.

#### `import_node_loads`
- Imports node loads from a CSV file specified by the user.
- The CSV file contains data such as ID, DIAMETER, RIM_ELEV, LOADs, and PATTERNs for up to 10 loads per manhole.
- Updates `hw_node` and `hw_subcatchment` objects in the open network with the imported data.

### Script Workflow

1. **Initialize**: The script starts by accessing the current open network in the ICM application.
2. **User Prompts**: Prompts the user to pick a scenario name that matches the InfoSewer dataset and to select a manhole folder containing the CSV file (`mhhyd.csv`) with manhole hydraulic and load data.
3. **Data Import**:
   - Reads the CSV file and stores each row as a hash in an array.
   - Iterates through the array to update corresponding `hw_node` and `hw_subcatchment` objects in the open network based on matching IDs.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calls `print_csv_inflows_file` to perform and print statistical analysis on selected fields from the `hw_node` objects.
5. **Scenario Handling**: Iterates through all scenarios in the open network, setting the current scenario and importing node loads for each scenario based on the selected manhole set (`MH_SET`).

### Key Points

- Uses `CSV.foreach` to read and process data from the CSV file.
- Utilizes `WSApplication.current_network` to access and manipulate the current open network in ICM InfoWorks.
- Employs a transactional approach (`transaction_begin` and `transaction_commit`) to ensure data integrity during updates.
- Provides user feedback and error handling through `WSApplication.message_box` and `puts` statements.

### Conclusion
The script facilitates the automated import of hydraulic and load data from an InfoSewer dataset into ICM InfoWorks, streamlining the process of updating network models based on external data sources.
