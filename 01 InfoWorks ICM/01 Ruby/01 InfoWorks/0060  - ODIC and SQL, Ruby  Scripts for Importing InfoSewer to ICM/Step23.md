# Code Summary: Enhancing Data Management in InfoSewer and ICM InfoWorks

## Libraries
- The script utilizes the `csv` library for handling CSV file operations.

## Key Functionalities
1. **Method: `print_csv_inflows_file(open_net)`**
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes and prints statistics for various fields related to SWMM network nodes.
   - **Process**:
     - Defines a set of database fields like 'us_invert', 'ds_invert', 'conduit_length', etc.
     - Collects data for these fields from the network.
     - Computes and prints statistical measures like minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and total for each field.
     - Uses formatted output for clarity.

2. **Method: `import_pipe_hydraulics(open_net)`**
   - **Purpose**: Imports pipe hydraulic data from a CSV file into the open network.
   - **Process**:
     - Prompts the user to select a scenario matching the InfoSewer dataset.
     - Reads data from a specified CSV file, creating a hash for each row with fields like 'ID', 'FROM_INV', 'TO_INV', etc.
     - For each row in the CSV, updates corresponding fields in the network's 'hw_conduit' objects.

3. **Execution Flow**
   - Accesses the current open network.
   - Iterates over each scenario in the network:
     - Sets the current scenario.
     - Begins a transaction.
     - Calls `import_pipe_hydraulics` to import data.
     - Commits the transaction.
     - Invokes `print_csv_inflows_file` to analyze and print the data.
   - Concludes with a message indicating the completion of the import process.

## Summary
This script stands out as a robust tool for importing and analyzing hydraulic data in InfoSewer scenarios, enhancing data accuracy and efficiency in water management systems. It demonstrates a thoughtful design, with user prompts for scenario selection and detailed statistical analysis of network data, thereby adding significant value to the data management processes in InfoSewer and ICM InfoWorks.
