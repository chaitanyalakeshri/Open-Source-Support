# Step 2 - Import Links in the Import of InfoSewer to ICM InfoWorks using ODIC

What is imported?
LInk Asset ID, From and To Nodes and a user_text_10 value of Pump.  This will change later when we import the link hydraulic information.  The file imported is the Link.CSV file and the CFG file Step2_InfoSewer_Link_csv.cfg into the conduit data table (see below).
