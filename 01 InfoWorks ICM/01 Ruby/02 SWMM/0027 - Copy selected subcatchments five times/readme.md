# The provided script performs the following actions:

It accesses the current active network in InfoWorks ICM.
It sets the number of copies for each selected subcatchment to 5.
The script then iterates through all subcatchment objects in the network.
For each selected subcatchment, it creates the specified number of copies (5 in this case).
Each copy of the subcatchment is given a new name with a "c<copy_number>" suffix.

All attributes (fields) of the original subcatchment, except its ID, are copied over to the new subcatchment.
These changes are saved (written) to the new subcatchment.
This process continues until all selected subcatchments have been copied the specified number of times.
