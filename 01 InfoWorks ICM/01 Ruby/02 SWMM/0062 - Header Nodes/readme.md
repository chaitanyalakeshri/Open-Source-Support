# Header Nodes
This Ruby script checks if there is an open network in WSApplication. If there is no open network, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it proceeds to get the current network and clears any previous selections. It then creates an array to store node IDs and validates if the '_nodes' object collection is not empty. If empty, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it stores node IDs into the 'node_ids' array from the '_nodes' object collection. Similarly, it creates an array to store downstream node IDs and validates if the '_links' object collection is not empty. If empty, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it stores downstream node IDs into the 'downstream_node_ids' array from the '_links' object collection.

Next, the script loops through each node ID and selects the node if it is not in the downstream node IDs array, indicating nodes without downstream connections. It then displays a message for each selected node. The script aims to assist in identifying nodes with missing downstream connections in the network.
